Below is a **live, runnable** Jupyter notebook powered by [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io).  
It runs **entirely in your browser** â€” no server, no Python install required.

{% raw %}
<jupyterlite-wasm
  src="{{ '/assets/notebooks/GmailToCalendar.ipynb' | relative_url }}"
  width="100%"
  height="600px">
</jupyterlite-wasm>
{% endraw %}

### How it Works
- **`<jupyterlite-wasm>`** is a custom web component provided by the JupyterLite team.
- Your `.ipynb` is fetched from `/assets/notebooks/`.
- All execution happens **clientâ€‘side** using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/).

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* You can change the `height="600px"` to make it taller.
